Pourtant très tôt pour les raisons économiques de cette régions je suis partie vivre à Paris(dont c\\'était mon plus grand rêve) et région parisienne avec sa culture et son ouverture d\\'esprit, cette ville m\\'a beaucoup apprise, ensuite j\\'ai eu l\\'opportunité de vivre au Portugal à Lisbonne (ville multiculturelle...) dont j\\'en suis tombé amoureuse sans savoir que j\\'y vivrais. Pendant cette période j\\'ai eu la chance de beaucoup voyager c\\'est grâce à ces atoûts que mon horizon s\\'est encore plus ouvert. Quand je voyage j\\'adore connaître les differentes cultures, musiques,spécialités culinaires, (Website hidden by Airbnb) pense que chaque coin du Monde appartiennent ses merveilles._x000D_\\n_x000D_\\nI\\'m from Pas-de-Calais and I\\'m very proud of my roots. Yet very early and for economic reasons, I went to live in Paris (which was my biggest dream). Paris taught me a lot with its culture and open-mindedness. Then I had the opportunity to live in Portugal, in Lisbon (multicultural city...), where I fell in love. During this period I had the chance to travel a lot, my horizon continued to expand. I love to travel and to know different cultures, music, culinary, etc. I think every corner of the world has its wonders. 28670    Nous avons passé un très bon séjour à Lisbonne...\\n28671    En mettant dans le frigidaire, une bouteille e...\\n28672    L\\'appartamento è stato occupato da due miei am...\\n28673    Great apartment very close to main attractions...\\n28674    Het appartement ligt prachtig in Alfama, op ee...\\n                               ...                        \\n28917    Cute little apartment that is great for a coup...\\n28918    We enjoyed our stay because of the location an...\\n28919    This spot was great, especially for the price!...\\n28920    Very easy communication, fast check-in, <br/>b...\\n28921    Normal... sinó eres muy refinado bien<br/>El gr...\\nName: 458, Length: 252, dtype: object', 'to': 'en'}]}]\n"

I collaborated with several newspapers and magazines in parallel with my main activity. I retired at the age of 56 and from there I was able to develop my true vocation. I have published 2 books (WAS IT YOU WHO WROTE ME FROM SINTRA?) and (THE DEATH OF THE KING OF SPAIN) and I continue to write with enthusiasm and passion. I read a lot, play golf, go hiking, regularly go to the movies. The trips I make are more about meeting people. I like landscapes with people better, as I always say.

My favorite authors will profile in my memory: Robert Musil (The Man Without Qualities is a total and profound repertoire about life and feelings), Arundathi Roy with the God of small things is an irremoustachible milestone in my life, John Irving, José Saramago, Guimarães Rosa and many others. Oh... And cooking is another thing I do on a daily basis with renewed pleasure. Soon I will start cooking for my guests in Sintra! The motto of my life is \"Nothing has ever been lost.
